Show node pool configuration alongside node metrics on a cluster's "Node pools" tab, which previously only answered how a pool was doing and never what it is.

- Selecting a node pool now opens a tabbed details section: **Configuration** (shown first) and **Nodes**, the latter being the existing per-node metrics table. The active tab lives in the URL next to the pool name (`?name=<pool>&tab=<tab>`), so a specific pool's configuration is linkable. Closing the section clears both parameters, and an unrecognised `tab` value falls back to Configuration rather than rendering an empty section.
- For **Karpenter** node pools the Configuration tab reads the `KarpenterMachinePool`, which inlines the upstream Karpenter `NodePool` and `EC2NodeClass` specs. This data was already being fetched and discarded — the row only ever used it to print the word "Karpenter".
- Because a Karpenter pool is a set of constraints rather than a fixed shape, the constraints are presented as a comparison: what the configuration **allows** beside what is **actually running**, one row per constraint. The running side is read from Karpenter's own metrics, which carry `capacity_type`, `arch` and instance labels that `kube_node_labels` does not. It is additive — when those metrics are unavailable, or a pool has no nodes yet, the configuration still renders in full and the running column is omitted rather than shown as zero.
- The tab is grouped by the questions a reader has rather than by the CRD's field layout: what is running now (node count, and CPU/memory against the pool's limits), what it may provision, when nodes churn (consolidation, expiry, disruption budgets, and the live disruption headroom), and what new nodes look like (AMI, root volume, taints, IAM role).
- Exclusions are unmistakably exclusions. A `NotIn` requirement renders as "any except" with outlined chips, distinguished by wording and shape rather than colour alone, and a key with no requirement at all reads as "Any" rather than blank — which is Karpenter's actual behaviour.
- The **Scaling** column now shows a Karpenter pool's real CPU/memory limits, or "Unlimited", in place of the uninformative literal "Karpenter-managed".
- AWS autoscaling-group and Azure node pools get the same tabbed section with a correspondingly briefer Configuration tab, so it behaves consistently whichever row is selected.
- An AWS installation that does not serve the Karpenter CRD no longer raises an error banner on this tab; a 404 there is a legitimate installation shape, not a fault.
- `ui-react`: new shared `FactList` — a compact list of label/value pairs laid out as horizontal rows separated by hairline rules, rendered as a `dl`/`dt`/`dd` so the pairing reaches assistive technology. The existing shared primitives (`ContentRow`, and `StructuredMetadataList` by default) stack a label _above_ its value, which is what made these detail cards several times taller than their content.
- `kubernetes-react`: `KarpenterMachinePool` gains configuration accessors (requirements, limits, weight, disruption and budgets, expiry, taints, node labels, AMI family and selector terms, block device mappings, kubelet, metadata options, IAM role, provider IDs, status conditions) plus exported types for the inlined `NodePool` and `EC2NodeClass` specs.
