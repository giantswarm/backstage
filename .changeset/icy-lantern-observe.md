Decouple custom branding from the gs-backend plugin. Branding asset serving moves to a dedicated `branding` backend plugin colocated in `packages/backend/src/branding/`, registered unconditionally so it works in deployments without a `gs:` config block. The frontend hook now resolves assets via the `branding` discovery prefix at `/api/branding/*`.
