# User Interface

When working with the Backstage user interface, e. g. in order to create new components, some resources will be helpful.

- Backstage uses [Material UI version 4](https://v4.mui.com/).

- The [Backstage Storybook](https://backstage.io/storybook/) allows to explore the existing UI components in a number of different states.
