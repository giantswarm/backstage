# @giantswarm/backstage-plugin-gs-node

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c117a5e: Support muster MCP servers behind per-user auth (`authProvider` entries in
  `aiChat.mcp`): the muster frontend now forwards the user's OAuth token to the
  muster-backend proxy, which opens per-user MCP sessions. Previously such
  servers were reported as unconfigured and the Workflows page failed with a 503.

  Also addresses review feedback on the initial muster plugins: the shared MCP
  client cache moved from ai-chat-backend to `@giantswarm/backstage-plugin-gs-node`
  and is reused by muster-backend; config parsing no longer throws on unnamed
  `aiChat.mcp` entries; muster-backend uses `@backstage/errors` classes instead
  of a hand-rolled error middleware; query parameter validation rejects empty
  and repeated values; execution fetch errors are surfaced in the UI instead of
  being silently swallowed; duplicate workflow step ids no longer drop nodes
  from the graph; and `formatDuration` is shared instead of copy-pasted.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 610ead0: Add `LatestOciReleaseProcessor` that annotates `Component` entities carrying `giantswarm.io/helmcharts` with `giantswarm.io/latest-release-tag` and `giantswarm.io/latest-release-date` from the referenced OCI registry. For multi-chart entities the highest-semver stable tag wins; prerelease tags are skipped. Toggle via `catalog.processors.latestOciRelease.enabled`.

  Introduce a new `@giantswarm/backstage-plugin-gs-node` node-library package and move the container-registry client code (`ContainerRegistryService`, `AcrRegistryClient`, `OciRegistryClient`, `RegistryAuthClient`, `RegistryError`, registry utils, and `containerRegistryServiceRef`) into it so it can be shared between `gs-backend` and the catalog module. Move `parseChartRef` from `plugins/gs` to `gs-common` so it can be used backend-side.
