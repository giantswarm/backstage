# Grafana

Giant Swarm provides Grafana in every management cluster.

Grafana provides access to Mimir metrics, Loki logs, and in some cases to tracing data. It also manages alerts.

The developer portal provides links to relevant Grafana entry points in several places:

- **On the installation (resource) entity page**, there are two links to Grafana. The teleport one is only accessible to Giant Swarm members and the preferred method for them. The other link is accessible to customers and Giant Swarm members alike.
- **On the cluster detail page**, there are links to a cluster overview dashboard (for that cluster) and to the Alerts section for that cluster in Grafana.
