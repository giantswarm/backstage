# @giantswarm/backstage-plugin-analytics-react

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c0ba49: Report meaningful portal actions through Backstage's analytics API: a new
  `analytics-react` library with the typed event list and `useTrackedMutation`.
  Creating an agent (`AgentPlatform.agentCreated`), starting a session
  (`AgentPlatform.sessionStarted`) and registering an MCP server
  (`Muster.mcpServerAdded`) are tracked; every other write opts out explicitly.
