## Development

**Important:** Make sure to use the right NodeJS version. See `"engines"` in [package.json](package.json) to find out which major versions are supported.

Initially, use `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date. This will take a few minutes at the first time, depending on internet bandwidth.

There are two ways to execute the app in development. Choose according to personal preference.

1. Start backend and frontend together via `yarn dev`.

2. Start backend and frotend separately.

   Backend: In one terminal, execute `yarn start-backend`.

   Frontend: In another terminal, run `yarn start`.
